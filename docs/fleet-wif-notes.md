# Fleet Workload Identity Authentication

This page contains example configuration to configure the `secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-gcp` provider 
with [Fleet Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/fleet-management/docs/use-workload-identity) 
authentication in environments configured for 
[Workload Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation) 
outside of the Google Cloud.

## `external_account` Credentials

Instead of the Google Service Account key file, it is possible to pass a Fleet Workload Identity configuration
JSON file to the process that needs authenticating to the Google API from the Kubernetes cluster configured for 
the Workload Identity Federation. The `secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-gcp` provider pods are such processes
that need to authenticate to the Google Secret Manager API to provide access to the application secrets.

Such configuration file contains `external_account` type of credential and does not contain any secrets similar to the
Google Service Account key. The configuration should be passed via the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` 
environment variable, which requires the file name of the file containing the configuration on 
the pod's local file system.

A ConfigMap to host the contents of the configuration file for the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable 
of pods on Kubernetes clusters, such as Anthos on Bare Metal clusters, that require accessing Google Cloud API using 
[Fleet Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/fleet-management/docs/use-workload-identity) can be created 
like illustrated in the following snippet:

---
```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  namespace: kube-system
  name: default-creds-config
data:
  config: |
    {
      "type": "external_account",
      "audience": "identitynamespace:$FLEET_PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog:https://gkehub.googleapis.com/projects/$FLEET_PROJECT_ID/locations/global/memberships/cluster1",
      "service_account_impersonation_url": "https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/GSA_NAME@GSA_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com:generateAccessToken",
      "subject_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt",
      "token_url": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/token",
      "credential_source": {
        "file": "/var/run/secrets/tokens/gcp-ksa/token"
      }
    }
EOF
```
---

Please note, that the `service_account_impersonation_url` attribute in the snippet above is only necessary if you 
link a Google Service Account with the Kubernetes Service account using `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account` annotation
and `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` IAM role. Otherwise, please omit the attribute in the configuration.

## Pass `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

Following snippet illustrates passing the ConfigMap with `external_account` credential to the 
`secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-gcp` provider pods that needs Fleet Workload Identity Authentication 
for accessing Google Secret Manager secrets using the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
